# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a dynamic knowledge filtering system for Large Language Models (LLMs) that enables context-aware parameter activation. The system allows an LLM to temporarily "forget" irrelevant knowledge domains while solving specific problems, focusing computational resources only on relevant parameters. This approach aims to reduce inference latency, memory usage, and computational load while maintaining or improving task-specific performance.

The core innovation lies in creating a meta-learning system that can identify which portions of the model's knowledge are relevant to a given query and dynamically mask or deactivate irrelevant parameters during inference, effectively creating specialized "views" of the same base model.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher using an LLM for domain-specific tasks, I want the model to focus only on relevant knowledge areas so that I get faster responses with better domain accuracy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a query with domain context THEN the system SHALL identify the relevant knowledge domains within 50ms
2. WHEN irrelevant parameters are identified THEN the system SHALL temporarily deactivate them during inference
3. WHEN processing domain-specific queries THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 30% reduction in active parameters
4. WHEN inference is complete THEN the system SHALL restore full model capacity for subsequent queries
5. IF domain classification confidence is below 0.8 THEN the system SHALL use full model capacity as fallback

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer integrating this system, I want configurable domain definitions so that I can customize knowledge filtering for my specific use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN users SHALL be able to define custom knowledge domains through configuration files
2. WHEN domain mappings are updated THEN the system SHALL rebuild parameter-domain associations within 5 minutes
3. WHEN multiple domains overlap THEN the system SHALL support weighted domain activation based on relevance scores
4. IF domain configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback to default domains
5. WHEN domain hierarchies are defined THEN the system SHALL support parent-child domain relationships

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want performance monitoring and analytics so that I can track the effectiveness of knowledge filtering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN knowledge filtering is active THEN the system SHALL log inference time, memory usage, and accuracy metrics
2. WHEN performance data is collected THEN the system SHALL provide real-time dashboards showing filtering effectiveness
3. WHEN accuracy drops below baseline THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and suggest parameter adjustments
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL compare filtered vs unfiltered performance across different domains
5. IF system performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically disable filtering and notify administrators

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an ML engineer, I want the filtering mechanism to be model-agnostic so that I can apply it to different LLM architectures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with new models THEN the system SHALL support transformer-based architectures (GPT, BERT, T5, etc.)
2. WHEN analyzing model parameters THEN the system SHALL automatically map layers to knowledge domains using attention analysis
3. WHEN different model sizes are used THEN the system SHALL scale filtering strategies appropriately
4. IF a model architecture is unsupported THEN the system SHALL provide clear compatibility requirements
5. WHEN model weights are updated THEN the system SHALL re-analyze parameter-domain mappings automatically

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user concerned about response quality, I want the system to maintain accuracy while improving performance so that filtered responses are as good as unfiltered ones.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN knowledge filtering is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain at least 95% of baseline accuracy for domain-specific tasks
2. WHEN cross-domain queries are detected THEN the system SHALL activate multiple relevant domains intelligently
3. WHEN uncertainty is high THEN the system SHALL gradually increase parameter activation until confidence thresholds are met
4. IF accuracy drops significantly THEN the system SHALL automatically fall back to full model inference
5. WHEN evaluating responses THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores for filtered vs unfiltered predictions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer building applications, I want seamless API integration so that I can easily incorporate dynamic filtering into existing workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API calls THEN users SHALL be able to specify domain hints through request parameters
2. WHEN no domain is specified THEN the system SHALL automatically detect the most relevant domain from query content
3. WHEN batch processing requests THEN the system SHALL optimize filtering across multiple queries simultaneously
4. IF API requests fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages with suggested fixes
5. WHEN streaming responses THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent filtering throughout the entire response generation
