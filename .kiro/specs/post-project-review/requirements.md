# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a comprehensive post-project review system for the Protein-Drug Discovery Platform that provides detailed technical analysis, impact assessment, and consumer-facing documentation. The system will generate structured reviews covering ML/DL models, algorithms, datasets, real-world applications, and consumer benefits to support project evaluation, stakeholder communication, and future development planning.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want a comprehensive technical review of our ML/DL models and algorithms, so that I can understand the technical foundation and capabilities of our platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a post-project review is requested THEN the system SHALL generate a detailed analysis of all ML/DL models used including ESM-2, LoRA, and associated algorithms
2. WHEN reviewing model architecture THEN the system SHALL document model specifications, parameter counts, training approaches, and performance characteristics
3. WHEN analyzing algorithms THEN the system SHALL explain protein sequence encoding, drug molecule processing, interaction prediction methods, and similarity calculations
4. IF technical details are requested THEN the system SHALL provide implementation specifics including attention mechanisms, embeddings, and activation functions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a research director, I want detailed information about datasets and training data, so that I can evaluate the scientific validity and scope of our platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dataset information is requested THEN the system SHALL document all datasets used including UniProt, ChEMBL, and BindingDB
2. WHEN describing dataset characteristics THEN the system SHALL provide size metrics, data types, coverage statistics, and quality indicators
3. WHEN analyzing data sources THEN the system SHALL explain how datasets contribute to model training and validation
4. IF data limitations exist THEN the system SHALL document known constraints and potential biases

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want to understand real-world problem solving capabilities, so that I can assess market impact and value proposition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN real-world impact is assessed THEN the system SHALL document specific problems solved including drug discovery acceleration, cost reduction, and research democratization
2. WHEN quantifying benefits THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on time savings, cost reductions, and accessibility improvements
3. WHEN comparing to traditional methods THEN the system SHALL highlight performance advantages and efficiency gains
4. IF success stories exist THEN the system SHALL document specific use cases and outcomes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to understand consumer-facing capabilities, so that I can evaluate market opportunities and user value.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN consumer capabilities are reviewed THEN the system SHALL document features accessible to non-expert users
2. WHEN describing user benefits THEN the system SHALL explain drug information access, personalized medicine support, and educational features
3. WHEN assessing accessibility THEN the system SHALL document hardware requirements, interface design, and usability features
4. IF consumer applications exist THEN the system SHALL provide examples of practical use cases for end users

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a technical lead, I want identification of platform limitations and future scope, so that I can plan development roadmap and set realistic expectations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN limitations are assessed THEN the system SHALL document current technical constraints, performance boundaries, and known issues
2. WHEN future scope is evaluated THEN the system SHALL identify potential enhancements, scalability options, and research directions
3. WHEN roadmap planning is needed THEN the system SHALL prioritize improvements based on impact and feasibility
4. IF risks exist THEN the system SHALL document technical debt, dependency issues, and mitigation strategies

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a documentation specialist, I want structured review output formats, so that I can create professional reports for different audiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating reviews THEN the system SHALL support multiple output formats including technical reports, executive summaries, and consumer guides
2. WHEN formatting content THEN the system SHALL use appropriate technical depth for target audience
3. WHEN structuring information THEN the system SHALL organize content logically with clear sections and subsections
4. IF visual elements are needed THEN the system SHALL support diagrams, charts, and technical illustrations
