# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an end-to-end protein-based drug discovery platform powered by fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs). The platform enables researchers to predict protein-drug interactions, visualize molecular structures, and accelerate pharmaceutical research through AI-driven insights. The system combines state-of-the-art protein language models (ESM-2) with interactive visualization tools and molecular docking capabilities to democratize drug discovery research.

The core innovation lies in creating an accessible, comprehensive AI platform that provides researchers with powerful prediction capabilities, intuitive visualization tools, and seamless integration with existing bioinformatics workflows.
